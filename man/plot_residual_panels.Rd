\description{
Each panel (El, Lat, Long) is built from three vertically stacked strips:
bottom \link{ymin, -band}, middle \link{-band, band}, and top \link{band, ymax}.
The strips have fixed relative heights, so the ±band lines land at the same
pixel positions across runs. The gap between strips is controlled in pixels.
Only the middle strip carries the Y-axis title; the X title is drawn outside
the strips to keep the top/bottom strips exactly the same height.
